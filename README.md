Data normalization and MySQL Workbench.  This is an assignment I completed during my Dev10 training:

## Introduction
The Ramsey County Tiny Theater Company manages three tiny theaters in the Saint Paul Metro. Each theater runs their own schedule of performances. Currently, RCTTC tracks ticket purchases in a spreadsheet since reservations are always made in person or via a phone call to the one and only office manager. There's never a chance of double-selling a ticket.

RCTTC is ready for their next step in professional theater; they're moving their reservation system online. They've enlisted your consulting firm to build a relational database that manages their data in a way that's technically sound and safe.

## High Level Requirements
- Use RCTTC's data to design a multi-table schema with appropriate relationships.
- Build a SQL DDL script to create the schema.
- Populate the database with sample data from a delimited data file. Save the DML SQL so it can be executed whenever needed.
- Write report queries and confirm they're working with sample data.
